Handmade sales and inventory system

This is a desktop-first prototype system designed for managing sales and stock of handmade items. It’s meant to be used by small business owners (like someone selling art or crafts) who need a simple way to track product movement, display inventory data visually, and store a basic sales history.
Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using ApexCharts for the visualizations. All data is stored in localStorage for now since this is just a prototype, a real database will be integrated in the full version.
Features:
Bar chart and area chart to show product counts and trends
Sales history tracking with timestamps
Quantity adjustments before purchase
Profile picture upload (saved locally)
Placeholder settings page (non-functional for now, except for changing of pfp)
Simple UI for selling and restocking items

Notes
This prototype focuses on desktop use only, so no responsive layout for smaller screens, because systems like these are rarely used on phones. Stock levels don’t update dynamically when selling or restocking just yet, but that’ll be handled in the final version once the database is in place. The password section is also just a visual placeholder for now.
